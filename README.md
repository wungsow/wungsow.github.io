# Tracker

A simple progressive web application made using [Inferno](https://infernojs.org/) and [create-inferno-app](https://github.com/infernojs/create-inferno-app) to record a user's daily weight.

The aim of the application is to provide a simple, lighweight tool that works offline and allows a daily weight to be quickly and easily recorded for the purpose of calulating a weekly (or longer) average weight that can then be recorded somwhere with more permanent storage.
